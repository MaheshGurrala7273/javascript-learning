## Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task or calculate a value.

Think of functions as a machine that takes some input, does some operations on it, and then produces an output. Here is an example of declaring a function:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Mahesh!");
}
```

In this example, we have declared a function called greet.

Inside that function, we have a console.log that logs the message Hello, Jessica!. 

If we tried to run this code, we would not see the message appear in the console. This is because we need to call the function.
