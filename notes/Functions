## Functions

Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task or calculate a value. 
Think of functions as a machine that takes some input, does some operations on it, and then produces an output. Here is an example of declaring a function:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Mahesh!");
}
